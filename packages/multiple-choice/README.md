## Usage 

To use this pie, you need to configure it within an Assessment Item. This means that you'll need to add it to the `index.html` and `config.json` files.

```html
<multiple-choice pie-id="1"></multiple-choice>
```

```javascript
{
  elements: {
    'multiple-choice': '~1.0.0'
  },
  models: [
    {
      id : "1",
      element: 'multiple-choice',
      prompt : "1 + 1 equals?",
      // more configuration...
    }
  ]
```

### Pie Demo 
There is a demo in `docs/demo` that you can run to see an example of it's usage.

To preview it in that context you'll need the [pie][pie] tool.

```shell
npm install -g pie 
cd multiple-choice/docs/demo
pie serve #will build and serve the pie... then go to http://localhost:4000
