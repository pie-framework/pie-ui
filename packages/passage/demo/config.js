          There's a dance in Billy Brennan's barn tonight,<br/>
          And there's the half-talk code of mysteries<br/>
          And the wink-and-elbow language of delight.<br/>
          Half-past eight and there is not a spot<br/>
          Upon a mile of road, no shadow thrown<br/>
          That might turn out a man or woman, not<br/>
          A footfall tapping secrecies of stone. <br/>
          <p/>
          I have what every poet hates in spite<br/>
          Of all the solemn talk of contemplation.<br/>
          Oh, Alexander Selkirk knew the plight<br/>
          Of being king and government and nation.<br/>
          A road, a mile of kingdom. I am king<br/>
          Of banks and stones and every blooming thing.<br/>
