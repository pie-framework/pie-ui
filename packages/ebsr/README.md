## Usage 

To use this pie, you need to configure it within an Assessment Item. This means that you'll need to add it to the `index.html` and `config.json` files.

```html
<ebsr pie-id="1"></ebsr>
```

```javascript
{
  elements: {
    'ebsr': '@pie-element/ebsr@^1.0.0'
  },
  models: [
    {
      id : "1",
      element: 'ebsr',
      partA: {
        prompt : "1 + 1 equals?",
        // more configuration...
      },   
      partB: {
        prompt : "What happens when you divide by 2 your answer in Part A?",
        // more configuration...
      },
    }
  ]
```
