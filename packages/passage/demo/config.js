      content: `The bicycles go by in twos and threes -<br/> 
      There's a dance in Billy Brennan's barn tonight,<br/>
      And there's the half-talk code of mysteries<br/>
      And the wink-and-elbow language of delight.<br/>
      Half-past eight and there is not a spot<br/>
      Upon a mile of road, no shadow thrown<br/>
      That might turn out a man or woman, not<br/>
      A footfall tapping secrecies of stone. <br/>
      <p/>
      I have what every poet hates in spite<br/>
      Of all the solemn talk of contemplation.<br/>
      Oh, Alexander Selkirk knew the plight<br/>
      Of being king and government and nation.<br/>
      A road, a mile of kingdom. I am king<br/>
      Of banks and stones and every blooming thing.<br/>
